                                Not anymore. The digital revolution has transformed the way we live and work today. And this
                                is only the beginning. DL GTPL is ushering in the benefits of new technologies into India.
                            </h5>
                            <h5 class="description">For the Cable TV viewer that means many more choices, much more control and unmatched quality.
                                Viewers across the country can now enjoy their favorite programmes in stereophonic sound
                                and crystal clear images. The reasonable price of the equipment only adds to the attraction.
                                More than 300 channels are on offer to begin with. They cover the entire spectrum of television
                                and radio programming including entertainment, news, sports, movies and more. Interactive
                                On-Screen Programming Guides mean that program listings, advance information, reminders and
                                parental control are all available at your fingertips.</h5>
                            <h5 class="description">In the foreseeable future, one can expect the television to come out of its existing avatar as
                                a passive medium and enter the exciting new world of electronic commerce and business. The
                                technologies for this already exist today and when complete convergence is achieved, DL GTPL
                                will be at the forefront of the revolution.
